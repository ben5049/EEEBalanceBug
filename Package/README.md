### Accessing the Command Station
Access [http://54.165.59.37/](http://54.165.59.37/) to control your rover and watch any replay.

Initially, your rover will appear as the ESP32's MAC address but you can add a nickname to make it easily identifiable. When your rover is online, you can connect to it and send commands to start autonomous mapping. You can also view all replays stored on the server.
