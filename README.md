# EEEBalanceBug

### Abstract
A two-wheeled balancing robotwas created to map a maze autonomously and calculate the shortest path.The maze wasbounded by LED strips, and up to 3 differently coloured beacons couldbe placed around the maze beforehand. The beacons must be powered througha carefully optimisedDC grid by solar power.There wasa budget of Â£60 for the robot. AnFPGA-based camera systemmust be used. Other optical sensors werepermitted, but no other cameras.The  methods  employed  includedesigning  an  advanced  embedded  system, hardware-basedimage processing, scalable cloud infrastructureand optimal energy distribution systems.
